# ForgeHax
A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod

If you want to build the project on your own, you need to either remove all references to JourneyMap or add the latest JourneyMap release into the libs/ folder

You should allocate more ram when running `setupDecompWorkspace` (around 4GB should be ok)

I recommend allocating more ram in both environments as the BlockEsp mod requires a lot of space for the vertex buffers. I might get around to fixing this if it becomes too big of an issue.
